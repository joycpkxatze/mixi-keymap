# mixi-keymap

This is a keymap code I write myself and modified from the original keymap code set by the maker of Mixi Macropad. The use of keymap code is to modified each key switch function according to the user desires.

In my case, I code the keymap according to my needs. I'll update the code as soon I add new features or key functions.
